#to install Faker, open up the terminal in your ideal IDE (I used Visual Studio) and type in "pip install Faker" https://pypi.org/project/Faker/

After installation, you will have all the required packages to run the script! Make sure each package is installed without error.
If not, try installing some of the packages separately (pip install " "). Make sure "from faker import Faker" is at the top of the file with "import time"
to run the file.
