# Project 2

Patrick Boddy

# Welcome to my page for my second project! I will be organizing my project in this folder.

This script will tell you the time and tell you how much space is on your hard drive. It will show total, used and free space.

The script will also print out basic system information to a .txt file and convert the .txt file to a PDF. 

To ensure the script runs properly, make sure you run "pip install fpdf" into the terminal. Without downloading the module, the script will error out and not work correctly.

If you are trying to use the script in the same path as the file, please delete the sysinfo.pdf and sysinfo.txt so new entries may be created. If you are not executing the script in the same path as these files, disregard. The files are added into this project to show the final product.
