# Project 3

Patrick Boddy

## Welcome to my third and final project! I will be organizing my project in this folder.

This script will host a flask webpage on localhost 5000. The webpage will be a lyric search that will take an artist and song name and then provide the lyrics to the song. For it to work correctly, the user will need to input a Genius client access token. The link for obtaining the token is found at: https://genius.com/api-clients. 

## Dependencies
To ensure the script runs properly, make sure to install flask and lyricsgenius. 

`pip install flask`
`pip install lyricsgenius`
